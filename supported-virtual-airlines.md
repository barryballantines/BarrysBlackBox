## List of Supported Virtual Airlines

Barry's BlackBox should work with every Virtual Airlines Website which is powered by phpVMS. 
Here is a list of VA's which have been checked so far:

| Virtual Airline           | kACARS URL                                                  | 
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [European Virtual Airlines](http://european.virtualairlines.eu) | http://european.virtualairlines.eu/action.php/kacars_free   |
| [Historic Airline Group](http://www.historicairlinegroup.com) | http://www.historicairlinegroup.com/action.php/kacars_free  |
| [Worldwide Virtual](http://www.worldwidevirtual.net) | http://www.worldwidevirtual.net/action.php/kacars_free |

If you do not find your favorite virtual airline in the table above, just try to append 
the path `/action.php/kacars_free` to the airlines host name. If for example your Airline site 
URL is `http://www.myFavoriteVA.com` and you see URLs like `http://www.myFavoriteVA.com/index.php/profile` 
in your browser, then you have a very good chance, that the correct kACARS URL is 
`http://www.myFavoriteVA.com/action.php/kacars_free`.
